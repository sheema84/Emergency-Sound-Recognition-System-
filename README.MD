# Assessing the effectiveness of an emergency sound recognition system utilizing frequency centric signal processing


1) The zip folder contains all the deliverables required for the Final Project.

2) Download the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and upload it to Jupyter notebook. Alternatively you can also copy paste this code to any other environment where python code can be executed.

3) Download the dependencies available in requirements.txt file. 

4) The dataset containing spectrogram images is present under the directory named: 'dataset' which needs to be      residing in the same directory the code base file resides.

5) The 'sound_1.wav' and 'sound_401.wav' are two random audio files drawn from the raw data pulled from Kaggle and the visualizations and signal transformations were performed on the same files. These needs to reside in the same directory as that of the code base.

6) Running the code in Jupyter notebook after following the above steps should produce appropriate results.
